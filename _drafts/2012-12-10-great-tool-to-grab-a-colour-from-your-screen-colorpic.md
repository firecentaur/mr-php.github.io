Ever wanted to grab a colour from an image that isn't in your image editor.  First you take a screen dump, then you load it into your image editor, then grab the colour.

ColorPic ends that!  Simply open the app, and the magnifier lets you grab palettes of up to 16 colors at once and use four advanced color mixers to select a spectrum of possibilities.

Download it for free at <a href="http://www.iconico.com/colorpic/">www.iconico.com/colorpic</a>.
