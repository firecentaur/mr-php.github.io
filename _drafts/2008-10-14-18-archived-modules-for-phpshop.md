title: 18 Archived Modules for phpShop
---
A few years ago I decided <a href="http://www.phpshop.org">phpShop</a> wasn't doing much and the community was nothing near the size of <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com">osCommerce</a> so I switched.  Managing and supporting the modules I had for phpShop became tedious so I removed them from the site.

As I check my backlinks, there is still requests for these files, even years later.  I checked on the phpShop project, and its still sitting steady at 0.8.1.  The project is still useful as a simple ecommerce engine that you can tweak so I have decided to republish the modules. 

I don't claim any of the code to be good, I wrote it a long time ago. I am simply providing them as resources for those who those who may like to take advantage of them.

The names of the files should explain the basics of what the module does. If in doubt, try it out!

Enjoy...
