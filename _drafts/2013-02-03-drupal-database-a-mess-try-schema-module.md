created: 1359935753

Drupal's Schema Module provides Schema-related functionality not provided by the core Schema API that is useful for module developers and system administrators.

It provides you with a list of tables that are not in any active modules so that you can cleanup old tables.  It also shows any modules that have mis-matching tables or fields.

Check it out at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/schema">drupal.org/project/schema</a>.
