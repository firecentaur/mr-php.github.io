Twitter's Bootstrap is sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.  On top of their fantastic features such as responsive themes for different size browsers and almost every web element styled in a way that makes you drool, they also provide extensive documentation so that it's easy to learn and use. 

Thank you to the twitter team for releasing this.   Find out more at <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter.github.com/bootstrap</a>.
