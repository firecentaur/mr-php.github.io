That's right!  MrPHP.com.au has officially upgraded from that 2000's feeling theme, powered by <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">Drupal6</a>, to a <strong>much nicer</strong> web 2.0 feeling theme powered by <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">Drupal7</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.

Since running Drupal7 will make it much easier to publish new content, we have decided to launch a Posts section.  It  which we will use to keep you informed of what's going on with MrPHP as well as and useful web services and general web gossip.
