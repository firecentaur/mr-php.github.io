# Mr PHP Website

Yep, not a single line of PHP code to run MrPHP.com.au, how ironic.

## To-Do's

### Continuous Integration

See: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/

On 2015-03-26 this organisation is not showing up in my travis profile here: http://travis-ci.org/profile/cornernote

### MrPHP.com.au Archive

Setup a subdomain for all old sites.

## Notes and How-To's

If you're editing this site then you will probably want to get familiar with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### Redirects

Add to page front matter:

```
---
redirect_from:
- "/blog/some-old-slug/"
---
```
